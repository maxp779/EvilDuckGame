This was the first ever game I made around 2011 when I started my Open Uni course. Its a basic 2D top down shooter where 
you shoot a giant duck in space. It uses the Java AWT toolkit so it requires Java to be installed in order to run. 
Ive polished up the code a little bit (a lot, my early code was horrible) and added a couple of features.

TO RUN THE GAME:
- Just download EvilDuckGame.zip
- Unzip it
- Double click the .jar and it should run as long as Java is installed
